 Project Name: Alzheimer's Disease Detection in MRI Image by Deep Learning: A Transfer Learning Approach 

Data Acquisition: The MRI images Dataset was utilized in this investigation. The Kaggle website was the source of the publicly available dataset. Mild demented, moderate demented, non-demented, and very mild demented pictures are included in this collection. The database was ideal for DL since it contained excellent quality, cleansed data. We extracted 6400 photos from the dataset.

Dataset Split: 5121 images for training, 640 images for validation, and 639 images for testing.

Data Augmentation: To improve model robustness and enrich the dataset, use data augmentation techniques. Zooming, flipping, and rotation are a few possible techniques. For pre-trained models, all those images are resized to 224 Ã— 224 pixels. We employed the data normalization technique to fit the models.

Deep Learning Models: We utilize three widely used DL architectures for feature extraction and classification: VGG16, EfficientNetB3, and EfficientNetB5.

Transfer Learning Phase: In Alzheimer's disease (AD) detection utilizing transfer learning, the process involves several key phases to effectively analyze brain images and classify potential instances of the disease.
